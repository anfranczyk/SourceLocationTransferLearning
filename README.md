# SourceLocationTransferLearning
Before running the sourceClassification.m script, extract the data contained in the data.7z file.
The classification results of the source areas are located in the "results" directory and are presented separately for each component of the wavefield. 
In addition to the calculated weights of the convolutional network (.mat file), there are also confussion matrices (stored in text and graphical form), a graph of the training process, as well as .xls files with detailed classification results.
